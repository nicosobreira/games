I.       How to play
_________________________________

Hacks for super metroid are single small IPS file 


What you need : 

- ROM of original "Super Metroid (JU) [!].smc", buy the game on virtual console or find it in abandonware or.....well you know how you can get it otherwise, but thats on your hand :>
- The IPS file which is the hack itself or mod
- A snes Emulator of your choice, such as snes9x or real snes if you are a badass and yes it has been tested
- An IPS patcher, this is the tool to apply mods (hacks) to the game. 
Since IPS only contain stuff made by the author of the mod, they cant work alone.
A good IPS patcher is lunar IPS.

This hack if for ROM with no header
Rom is headered?: -> https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+remove+the+header+of+an+snes+rom

Well I strongly consider you should do super metroid original before playing mods if you havent,
Even if this mod can be played without doing it.
See IV. for controls and tips which will settle you before actually playing

II.    General Info about what is this hack ?
____________________________________________________


Ascent is a full hack. This mean it is a full expansion mod, its like playing more super metroid with same gameplay but new level design, visual and some new mechanics. It has approximately the same amount of rooms as original game but bigger rooms and the difficulty is harder than original but not too much. It is not Kaizo hard and its mean to be enjoyed by veteran and newcomers, veterans will be able to break new ways of progression and to play. The hack gameplay focus on puzzles, exploration and challenges. The focus on puzzles is stronger than most hacks. However there is multiple ways to advance or solve a problem. The hack also follow a rythm of big portion of calm and problem solving vs small moments of action. There could be some weird moments of me trying stuff :D, but nothing will be out of place assets or ideas. Metroid for me is a huge alien underground isolated maze and this is what it will be about.

III.    Detailed Info about what is this hack ?
____________________________________________________

As the title say it, Ascent is all about ascending to the surface, the extraction point, to retreive your ship and leave the planet. 
The main idea of this hack is like 3 small hacks put into one with a connected progression and world. They are stacked on top of each other to form what I call ¨The Tower¨
Start at the abyss of the planet and ascend your way up to the surface. 
Separated into 3 Zones.
You cannot come back to the previous zones or some parts, the level design isnt made for that and story wise it will be weird. The idea too, is to reduce backtracking and let the player progress ahead. 
Each Zones finish with the main boss + entering yellow area on the map means no return 
The no return rule can be broken in zone 2 for a surprise so keep your eyes peel
Can collect all items in each of the zone before leaving.
The items percentage is 100% for each zones in the pause menu, the total is still 100 but based for all items
Each Zone has visual diversity and they each feel like a small hack with their own exploration. 
Animals can be saved, thats the only thing I can say about that :>

There is linked doors in this hack where destroying one cap of a specific label will open all of the same label
There is also gates without button that you must break open in another room near it

Tested Low% (really hard mode):
-> 1 pack of everything (missiles, supers, powa bombs, Etank) 
-> morph + bombs
-> ice beam (other item than that possible)
-> varia
-> charge
-> and speed boost ofc

*no etank possible in newer version but not recommended




____________________________________________________

IV. Controls & new important moves
____________________________________________________

The controls are your typical super metroid controls, but there is a few things.

-Samus can spin jump again (respin) by pressing the jump button while in midair during a normal jump or a fall.

-Quick switch for beams has been added, Hold down Cancel button then Diagonal Down button to equip the ice version of your current beam if you have ice. Do it again to unequip ice. Also, you can Hold down Cancel button then Diagonal up button and each time you press Diagonal up button while holding cancel, it will cycle through your beams. Only the unstacked ones.

-While running in full speed in speed booster, samus can reduce her speed by letting go the run button. This way you can see ahead making it easier to naviguate while speed boosting

-Samus can keep the speed booster active while running if she jump then land, must be a spin jump

-Hold down in ball form to remove the bomb jumping, useful for spamming secrets

-Samus can morph while running and unmorph to keep speed but only work when a specific item is aquired


- Bombs are faster, this means less tedious secret finding 
but this means easy and fast bomb jumping so its not infinite anymore and has a limit of 7 bomb jumps
I know some will hate that, the change was analysed many times in beta and its decided the level design and other items depend on it
A visual indicator was added to the ball and will start getting glowy and flash when the bomb jump is exhausted.


- Physics in water suitless are a bit different and samus will keep her momentum when she jump then land if player is still holding a direction



--Required advanced techniques--

You will need to know how to bomb jump lol. And how to shinespark at least once to finish this hack. Walljumps will just help alot to shortcut the hack but they arent required, both techniques will be shown in the hack itself by friends :D
thats pretty much it, so not alot of advance stuff required.

V. Other Important changes + new stuff
____________________________________________________

---------------------------
New items and items edits
---------------------------

-> Spring Ball come packed with high jump

-> Each Weapon tanks increase samus missiles, supers & beams projectiles damage (damage xNumber in Equip screen) and can change alot in how player will approach strong enemies and obstacles

-> Each Energy Drain reducer item will reduce ShineSpark damage to samus allowing longer moments in the air

-> Classic Boost Ball is in this too, hold run in morph ball until glow then release button, main use for crumble bridges and bypassing single pushy block (arrow pushing samus blocks), enable morph ball speed keep mentioned above
has other uses...

-> Shinespark can be controlled in various ways by pressing directions
(pressing down will morph, pressing jump will cancel the spark midair, pressing down (ball form) then jump will take a spin pose, samus can be steered with diagonals aim buttons)

-> space jump is... fixed :p


-------------------------
New blocks and edits
-------------------------

-> Spikes deal more damage as progression advance

-> Pushy arrow blocks that will push samus in the direction of the arrow, can be bypassed with some items 
There is also a single use pink version that act as sinking sand.

-> Electric Fog that will either heal or damage samus depending of the color (color change to more damage as progression advance)

-> Green button block and red that enable a gravity switch in morph ball until samus unmorph in air or touch the red one (red can extend with doted lines)

-> Hyper Block button that enable hyper

-> Electric grapple block that will damage samus when grappled in them

-> Blocks that can appear and disappear on a timer

-----------------------
Other
-----------------------

-> Any water cancel toxic heat damage to samus

VI. Hints to help you through the game
____________________________________________________


-Pay some attention to the room names, mostly the pink ones to get clues 

-Notice how those weird colorful squares grid enemies are near stations

-Use the map to get info of what to do next, look for ? on the map for goals and blue dots tiles for items
also look for bright D tiles or key symbol tiles will help to open more paths

-The yellow parts on the map are the end of the current zone, warning those are no return 

-Those dark enemies are dark but also colored, maybe they arent that much damage spongy afterall
Also the HUD selection show different colors

-Sometimes simply looking around the room will help to advance in it

-Enemies freeze longer with a charged shot

-Pay attention to why samus energy can lower or increment depending of the situation you are in to understand it

-Beams are more based on situations and personal taste rather than new beam = better never use the others ever again
but there is a good reason for getting all of them

-An hard no with spikes that block path is indeed an hard no and there must be something you are missing
You can always come back later and dont forget that alot of things arent required necessarly 
but if you feel you can push through it then it must be possible and not that hard afterall
